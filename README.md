# Group Contract

## Communication
1. Team Meetings
We will meet two times a week, on Tuesdays and Saturdays, for at least 30 minutes each time. The meeting location will vary from in person to zoom depending on availability. Meeting times will be scheduled at least two days in advance of each meeting.
We will use messages or SMS messages as the primary form of communication between group members.
Notes will be taken each meeting by Alvin. 
2. Assistance
The contact method will be through messages. Each group memberâ€™s phone numbers is listed as follows:
YouYou Yu: (917) 951-3670; Alan Yao: (720) 710-7120; Ben Clarage: (815) 994-8863; Alvin Zhang: (510) 378-5717
Responses should be within 18 hours, barring emergencies that would not allow for a response in such time.
3. Respect
Team members have to respect each other.
Each person will have an equal say on project ideas or related issues.
Every member will actively listen and engage with the thoughts of others.
Decisions will be accepted if a unanimous majority of the members agree with the decision.

## Collaboration
1.  Work Distribution
Each person should work an equal amount over the entire project
We will identify the strengths and desires of each team member when distributing the work. 

## 2. Time Commitment
Outside of meeting times, each member will spend at least 1.5 hours of work per week working on the project.
Accnoklending, at the time of writing, there are no prior time commitments that need to be accounted for.
If any new conflicts of commitments arise, team members will be transparent and let other group members know as soon as possible.

## 3. Conflict Resolution
If there is a conflict among team members, the resolution will be made by rational and friendly discussion, resulting in unanimous agreement. 
If conflicts cannot be resolved, everyone must do a Leetcode hard and whoever does it the fastest decides on the final decision. 

## 4. Additional 
All members agree to give their best effort to get an A.
A group member who is absent more than 2 times either in a class meeting or outside group meeting without any notice will be dismissed from the group.
Each member has responsibility to professionally work on assignments, and agrees to familiarize themselves with the Student Code of Conduct.
