Meeting Duration: ~2:20PM - 3:30 PM
We worked together on the team contract as well as the project proposal. 
Both files have been "submitted" and added to the project repository. 
Ben will start to work on writing the script for the data collection, and hopes 
to finish in a few days. He will most likely be using Python for this. Alvin, YouYou,
and Alan will figure out how to use process the data either using an existing library
or making a class to do that. Our next meeting will be on November 9th. We will be
scheduling that later by the end of the day.
